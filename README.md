# CodeCracker

## The Repository

This project is the CodeCracker challenge where i tried to implement some clean code principles and unit testing.
The whole project was developed in C#.

## The CodeCracker Problem

Rules of the CodeCracker, according to the [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/CodeCracker/).

- Given an alphabet decryption key like the one below, create a program that can crack any message using the decryption key.

- **Alphabet:**
>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

- **Decryption Key:** 
>! ) " ( Â£ * % & > < @ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o 

- You could also create a encryption program that will encrypt any message you give it using the key.
